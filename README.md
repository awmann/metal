metal
=====

Contains programs and data for calculating M dwarf metallicities.

am_getmetal is designed to work on optical, J, H, or K band spectra and on K5-M5 dwarf stars.

am_getmetal_late only works on K band spectra, and is designed to work on M4.5-M9.5 dwarf stars

Read the comets in each program for a better understanding of syntax, program restrictions, etc. Don't forget to put your spectra in the star's rest frame.
