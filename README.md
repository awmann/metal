metal
=====

Contains programs and data for calculating M dwarf metallicities.

<<<<<<< HEAD
am_getmetal: good for K5-M5 dwarfs, visible, J, H, and K band relations. See http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AJ....145...52M

am_getmetal_late only works on K band spectra, and is designed to work on M4.5-M9.5 dwarf stars. See http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1403.5560

Read the comets in each program for a better understanding of syntax, program restrictions, etc. Don't forget to put your spectra in the star's rest frame.

You might also need the RV code, which is now on gitub: https://github.com/awmann/RV_code
